Arrange the veggies in a grill pan and place on the cooler side of the grill to cook, tossing occasionally until veggies are charred and softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Arrange the patties on the cool side of the grill with lid closed, cooking to desired temperature, flipping once halfway through for even cooking. Toast the buns. With a minute to go, arrange the cheese over the burgers and close the lid to allow the cheese to melt. Remove from grill and allow to rest. Arrange the buns with lettuce and tomato if desired. Top with a burger, fresh grilled onions and peppers. Top off with the buns and serve",
