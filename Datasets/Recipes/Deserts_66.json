Spoon meringue into piping bag. Pipe small pointed mounds (about 1/2 inch/1.2 cm high and 1 inch/2.5 cm in diameter) about 2 inches (5cm) apart onto greased cookie sheets. Bake on lowest rack in 225°F/110°C oven for 35 to 40 minutes until dry. Turn oven off. Let meringues stand in oven until cool. Heat chocolate on double boiler, stirring often, until almost melted. Dip 1/2 of each meringue into chocolate, allowing excess to drip back into saucepan. Place on foil or waxed paper-lined cookie sheets. Let stand in cool place until chocolate is set. Do not chill.",
