  "ingredients": "Ingredients for Meethi Seviyan Recipe: 200 g Vermicelli 350 g Sugar 1-¾ cups Water 4 tbsp Clarified butter 10 â 12 Green cardamoms, ground 2 - 2½ cups Milk A pinch Saffron 1 â 2 tbsp Almonds, slivered 1 â 2 tbsp Pistachios, slivered 1 tbsp Rosewater A squeeze Lemon juice",
  "instructions": "Place sugar into the water and bring to the boil. Remove from heat and keep aside. Melt the ghee over a low heat in a wok or wide saucepan. Add the vermicelli and the crushed cardamoms. Fry over a medium to high heat, stirring the vermicelli around so that they brown evenly. Once the vermicelli have turned a light golden brown, pour in the sugar syrup and continue to cook over a low heat for around 15 minutes. As the water evaporates, the vermicelli will stiffen a little and the ghee will separate. At this stage, add the milk. Bring to the boil then add the lemon juice. Continue to stir fry for a few minutes and then add the saffron, almonds, pistachio, and rosewater. Continue to fry for a minute or so. Serve hot or cold. Best served 20 minutes after cooking.",
