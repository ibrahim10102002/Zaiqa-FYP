  "ingredients": "Ingredients for Gulab Jamun Recipe: Flour 1/2 cup Finely crumbled khoya 1 cup Baking soda 1/4 tsp Green cardamom powder a pinch Saffron few strands For Sugar Syrup: Sugar 2-1/2 cups Water 1-1/4 cups Oil for deep frying",
  "instructions": "In a bowl, add the crumbled khoya and flour and baking soda. Mix well. Add very little water at a time to make smooth but firm dough. Donât knead dough. Keep aside. In a pan add water and sugar to make sugar syrup, remove scum from sugar water if any. Add the cardamom powder. Let the sugar syrup thicken very lightly. It should be sticky to touch, remove from flame and let cool for a while. Saffron strands may be added if using. Meanwhile start making small jamun balls. When the oil is heated to a medium, drop the jamun balls carefully from sides taking care not to crowd too much in the pan. Take a ladle and turn the jamun balls while frying as they tend to stick in the bottom when first dropped in oil for frying. Just roll the jamun balls all over to enable uniform cooking and colour. When almost deep reddish colour, remove drain oil on a paper towel. Drop these jamuns into the prepared sugar syrup. Let them remain immersed in syrup for some time. Serve either chilled or warm.",
